# attractors

Attractors in Rust. See [Paul Bourke's site on Peter de Jong attractors](http://paulbourke.net/fractals/peterdejong/) for an explanation. All code is commented. This implementation is tested on \*nix only.

## examples

*a = 2.01, b = 2.53, c = 1.61, d = -0.33*
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haydenhigg/attractors/main/examples/1.jpg" alt="1" width="50%"/>

*a = -2.0, b = -2.0, c = -1.2, d = 2.0*
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haydenhigg/attractors/main/examples/2.jpg" alt="2" width="50%"/>

*a = 0.56, b = -5.6, c = -1.9, d = 2.0*

## to-do
